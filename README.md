BUILDING  YOUR  WORLD

Create a 2D world that will play host to a game to be played by your agent types. Providecontext for the mechanics of the 
world and the conditions under which the game is complete. The intent of this exercise is for you to demonstrate your 
understanding of how a problem canbe modeled abstractly.  To this end, provide a well a defined task environment, 
implementthreedifferentagent types and provide a PEAS description for each.

•  Critique the advantages and disadvantages of each agent type.
•  Demonstrate  each  agents  ability  to  perform  or  under-perform  in  the  2-dimensionalworld.
•  Discuss, and evaluate, the agents suitability to operate in world of varying sizes.

The solution should be implemented in Python, you may use any of the libraries made avail-able from the AIMA python repository
but they must be clearly referenced (see note on im-porting code under submission), you will be graded on your contribution and 
this should beclearly highlighted.

Write  a  clear  and  concise  description  of  the  agent-based  world.   The  purpose  of  this  is  toarticulate an understanding 
of the underlying concepts being implemented both from a the-oretical and practical perspective.

SEARCHING  YOUR  WORLD

•  Formulate  a  well  definedproblem statementand  identify  agoal-stateunder  whichyour game is complete.  
Why is this important to search?  As part of your solution youshould be including the initial state, the set 
of actions, the transition model, a goal testfunction and a path cost function.
•  Select threeuninformed searchtechniques and discuss their appropriateness to yourworld under appropriate 
headings for evaluating problem-solving performance. Im-plement theuninformed searchtechniques and discuss the results.
•  Select  threeinformed searchtechniques  and  discuss  their  appropriateness  to  yourworld under appropriate headings 
for evaluating problem-solving performance. Im-plement theinformed searchtechniques and discuss the results.

Write a clear and concise report detailing the search techniques performance in your agent-based game for the relevant agent types. 
The purpose of this is to articulate an understandingof the underlying concepts, and limitations, being implemented both from a 
theoretical andpractical perspective.

FORWARD-CHAINING  AND BACKWARD-CHAINING

Forward-Chaining and Backward-Chaining introduces the capacity for inference in an en-vironment.  How does this benefit the operation 
of an agent, in particularly in your world?Provide a short critical analysis of both approaches. Thereafter demonstrate their applicabil-ity 
by utilising them in your world.
